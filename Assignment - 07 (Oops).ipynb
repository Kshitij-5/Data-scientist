This ensures that the derived classes fulfill the contract and provide the necessary functionality.\n",

By defining abstract methods with default implementations or implementing common functionality in the base class, you can reuse code across different subclasses.

    "\n",
    "2. Use access modifiers: Python provides access modifiers to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). The common access modifiers are:\n",
    "* Public : No access modifier needed. Public members are accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "* Protected : Use a single underscore (_) prefix. Protected members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "* Private : Use a double underscore (__) prefix. Private members are accessible only within the class itself.\n",

    "3. Encapsulate the data: Encapsulate the data by defining class attributes and methods. Keep the internal data hidden or protected by using appropriate access modifiers. This prevents direct access to the internal state of the object and enforces controlled access through defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide public methods: Define public methods within the class that allow external code to interact with the data. These methods serve as the interface through which the external code can perform operations on the data.
